The story was interesting, and I love that the devs of the game took the time to explain and guide us. There were some issues with the speed of the character, and the character going through walls at some occasion, but it's still all good!</div>

Knew only a little about the game as we were only told to answer the evaluation after playing it for a bit. Wish we were given more context on the game as we were a little bit lost on its objective.</div>
